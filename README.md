# Russian Roulette Game

This project is a Java console-based game inspired by the concept of Russian roulette. In this game, two players take turns selecting numbers, and if their chosen number matches the randomly generated one, they "get shot."

## Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your system. Simply compile the Java files and execute the `Main` class to start the game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played between two players.
- Each player takes turns choosing a number from 1 to 6.
- If a player's chosen number matches the randomly generated number, they "get shot" and the game ends.
- Players must enter valid numbers between 1 and 6.
- The game provides an option for players who get shot to perform a fun activity as a penalty.

## How to Play

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac Main.java
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```
   java Main
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: Entry point of the game.
- `BlankTest.java`: Contains the game logic and main functionality.
- `Player.java`: Manages player actions and input.
- `InputChecker.java`: Validates player inputs and checks for "shots."
- `Roulette.java`: Generates a random number for the game.
- `FunActivity.java`: Implements fun activities for players who get shot.

## Potential Bugs Disclaimer
